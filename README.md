# Clothing Similarity Project

This project aims to provide a clothing similarity search functionality using natural language processing techniques. Given a user's input text describing a desired clothing item, the system retrieves and ranks similar clothing items from a pre-defined dataset.
Overview

The clothing similarity project leverages the power of word embeddings and cosine similarity to find similarities between clothing items based on their descriptions. The Word2Vec model is used to encode text into numerical feature vectors, and cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity scores. The dataset used in this project is created by scraping clothing data from Myntra.com and Ajio.com.
